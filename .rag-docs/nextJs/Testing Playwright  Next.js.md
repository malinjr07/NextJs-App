## How to set up Playwright with Next.js

Last updated

Playwright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write **End-to-End (E2E)** testing. This guide will show you how to set up Playwright with Next.js and write your first tests.

## Quickstart[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright#quickstart)

The fastest way to get started is to use `create-next-app` with the [with-playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright). This will create a Next.js project complete with Playwright configured.

## Manual setup[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright#manual-setup)

To install Playwright, run the following command:

This will take you through a series of prompts to setup and configure Playwright for your project, including adding a `playwright.config.ts` file. Please refer to the [Playwright installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation) for the step-by-step guide.

## Creating your first Playwright E2E test[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright#creating-your-first-playwright-e2e-test)

Create two new Next.js pages:

Then, add a test to verify that your navigation is working correctly:

> **Good to know**: You can use `page.goto("/")` instead of `page.goto("http://localhost:3000/")`, if you add [`"baseURL": "http://localhost:3000"`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) to the `playwright.config.ts` [configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).

### Running your Playwright tests[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright#running-your-playwright-tests)

Playwright will simulate a user navigating your application using three browsers: Chromium, Firefox and Webkit, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.

Run `npm run build` and `npm run start`, then run `npx playwright test` in another terminal window to run the Playwright tests.

> **Good to know**: Alternatively, you can use the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver/) feature to let Playwright start the development server and wait until it's fully available.

### Running Playwright on Continuous Integration (CI)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright#running-playwright-on-continuous-integration-ci)

Playwright will by default run your tests in the [headless mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#running-headed). To install all the Playwright dependencies, run `npx playwright install-deps`.
