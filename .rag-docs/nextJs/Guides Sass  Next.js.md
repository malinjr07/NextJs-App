Next.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the `.scss` and `.sass` extensions. You can use component-level Sass via CSS Modules and the `.module.scss`or `.module.sass` extension.

First, install [`sass`](https://github.com/sass/sass):

> **Good to know**:
> 
> Sass supports [two different syntaxes](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), each with their own extension. The `.scss` extension requires you use the [SCSS syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss), while the `.sass` extension requires you use the [Indented Syntax ("Sass")](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#the-indented-syntax).
> 
> If you're not sure which to choose, start with the `.scss` extension which is a superset of CSS, and doesn't require you learn the Indented Syntax ("Sass").

### Customizing Sass Options[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/sass#customizing-sass-options)

If you want to configure your Sass options, use `sassOptions` in `next.config`.

#### Implementation[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/sass#implementation)

You can use the `implementation` property to specify the Sass implementation to use. By default, Next.js uses the [`sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) package.

### Sass Variables[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/sass#sass-variables)
