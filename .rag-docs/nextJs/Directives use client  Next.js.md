The `'use client'` directive declares an entry point for the components to be rendered on the **client side** and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature.

> **Good to know:**

> You do not need to add the `'use client'` directive to every file that contains Client Components. You only need to add it to the files whose components you want to render directly within Server Components. The `'use client'` directive defines the client-server [boundary](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#network-boundary), and the components exported from such a file serve as entry points to the client.

## Usage[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-client#usage)

To declare an entry point for the Client Components, add the `'use client'` directive **at the top of the file**, before any imports:

When using the `'use client'` directive, the props of the Client Components must be [serializable](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types). This means the props need to be in a format that React can serialize when sending data from the server to the client.

## Nesting Client Components within Server Components[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-client#nesting-client-components-within-server-components)

Combining Server and Client Components allows you to build applications that are both performant and interactive:

1.  **Server Components**: Use for static content, data fetching, and SEO-friendly elements.
2.  **Client Components**: Use for interactive elements that require state, effects, or browser APIs.
3.  **Component composition**: Nest Client Components within Server Components as needed for a clear separation of server and client logic.

In the following example:

-   `Header` is a Server Component handling static content.
-   `Counter` is a Client Component enabling interactivity within the page.
