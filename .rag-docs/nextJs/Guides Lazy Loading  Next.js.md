## How to lazy load Client Components and libraries

Last updated

[Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading) in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route.

It allows you to defer loading of **Client Components** and imported libraries, and only include them in the client bundle when they're needed. For example, you might want to defer loading a modal until a user clicks to open it.

There are two ways you can implement lazy loading in Next.js:

1.  Using [Dynamic Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#nextdynamic) with `next/dynamic`
2.  Using [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) with [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)

By default, Server Components are automatically [code split](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting), and you can use [streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) to progressively send pieces of UI from the server to the client. Lazy loading applies to Client Components.

## `next/dynamic`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#nextdynamic)

`next/dynamic` is a composite of [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) and [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It behaves the same way in the `app` and `pages` directories to allow for incremental migration.

## Examples[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#examples)

### Importing Client Components[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#importing-client-components)

> **Note:** When a Server Component dynamically imports a Client Component, automatic [code splitting](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting) is currently **not** supported.

### Skipping SSR[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#skipping-ssr)

When using `React.lazy()` and Suspense, Client Components will be [prerendered](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/4) (SSR) by default.

> **Note:** `ssr: false` option will only work for Client Components, move it into Client Components ensure the client code-splitting working properly.

If you want to disable pre-rendering for a Client Component, you can use the `ssr` option set to `false`:

### Importing Server Components[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#importing-server-components)

If you dynamically import a Server Component, only the Client Components that are children of the Server Component will be lazy-loaded - not the Server Component itself. It will also help preload the static assets such as CSS when you're using it in Server Components.

> **Note:** `ssr: false` option is not supported in Server Components. You will see an error if you try to use it in Server Components. `ssr: false` is not allowed with `next/dynamic` in Server Components. Please move it into a Client Component.

### Loading External Libraries[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#loading-external-libraries)

External libraries can be loaded on demand using the [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) function. This example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search. The module is only loaded on the client after the user types in the search input.

### Adding a custom loading component[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#adding-a-custom-loading-component)

### Importing Named Exports[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/lazy-loading#importing-named-exports)

To dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the Promise returned by [`import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) function:
