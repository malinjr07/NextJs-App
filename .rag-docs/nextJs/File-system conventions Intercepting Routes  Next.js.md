Intercepting routes allows you to load a route from another part of your application within the current layout. This routing paradigm can be useful when you want to display the content of a route without the user switching to a different context.

For example, when clicking on a photo in a feed, you can display the photo in a modal, overlaying the feed. In this case, Next.js intercepts the `/photo/123` route, masks the URL, and overlays it over `/feed`.

However, when navigating to the photo by clicking a shareable URL or by refreshing the page, the entire photo page should render instead of the modal. No route interception should occur.

## Convention[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)

Intercepting routes can be defined with the `(..)` convention, which is similar to relative path convention `../` but for route segments.

You can use:

-   `(.)` to match segments on the **same level**
-   `(..)` to match segments **one level above**
-   `(..)(..)` to match segments **two levels above**
-   `(...)` to match segments from the **root** `app` directory

For example, you can intercept the `photo` segment from within the `feed` segment by creating a `(..)photo` directory.

> **Good to know:** The `(..)` convention is based on _route segments_, not the file-system. For example, it does not consider `@slot` folders in [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes).

## Examples[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#examples)

### Modals[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#modals)

Intercepting Routes can be used together with [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes) to create modals. This allows you to solve common challenges when building modals, such as:

-   Making the modal content **shareable through a URL**.
-   **Preserving context** when the page is refreshed, instead of closing the modal.
-   **Closing the modal on backwards navigation** rather than going to the previous route.
-   **Reopening the modal on forwards navigation**.

Consider the following UI pattern, where a user can open a photo modal from a gallery using client-side navigation, or navigate to the photo page directly from a shareable URL:

![Intercepting routes modal example](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fintercepted-routes-modal-example.png&w=3840&q=75)

In the above example, the path to the `photo` segment can use the `(..)` matcher since `@modal` is a slot and **not** a segment. This means that the `photo` route is only one segment level higher, despite being two file-system levels higher.

See the [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#modals) documentation for a step-by-step example, or see our [image gallery example](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram).
