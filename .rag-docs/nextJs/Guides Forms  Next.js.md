## How to create forms with Server Actions

Last updated

React Server Actions are [Server Functions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions) that execute on the server. They can be called in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions. This guide will walk you through how to create forms in Next.js with Server Actions.

## How it works[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#how-it-works)

React extends the HTML [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) element to allow Server Actions to be invoked with the [`action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) attribute.

When used in a form, the function automatically receives the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FormData/FormData) object. You can then extract the data using the native [`FormData` methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData#instance_methods):

> **Good to know:** When working with forms that have multiple fields, use JavaScript's [`Object.fromEntries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries). For example: `const rawFormData = Object.fromEntries(formData)`. Note that this object will contain extra properties prefixed with `$ACTION_`.

## Passing additional arguments[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#passing-additional-arguments)

Outside of form fields, you can pass additional arguments to a Server Function using the JavaScript [`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) method. For example, to pass the `userId` argument to the `updateUser` Server Function:

The Server Function will receive the `userId` as an additional argument:

> **Good to know**:

> -   `bind` works in both Server and Client Components and supports progressive enhancement.

## Form validation[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#form-validation)

Forms can be validated on the client or server.

-   For **client-side validation**, you can use the HTML attributes like `required` and `type="email"` for basic validation.
-   For **server-side validation**, you can use a library like [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the form fields. For example:

## Validation errors[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#validation-errors)

To display validation errors or messages, turn the component that defines the `<form>` into a Client Component and use React [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState).

When using `useActionState`, the Server function signature will change to receive a new `prevState` or `initialState` parameter as its first argument.

You can then conditionally render the error message based on the `state` object.

## Pending states[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#pending-states)

The [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState) hook exposes a `pending` boolean that can be used to show a loading indicator or disable the submit button while the action is being executed.

Alternatively, you can use the [`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) hook to show a loading indicator while the action is being executed. When using this hook, you'll need to create a separate component to render the loading indicator. For example, to disable the button when the action is pending:

You can then nest the `SubmitButton` component inside the form:

> **Good to know:** In React 19, `useFormStatus` includes additional keys on the returned object, like data, method, and action. If you are not using React 19, only the `pending` key is available.

## Optimistic updates[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#optimistic-updates)

You can use the React [`useOptimistic`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) hook to optimistically update the UI before the Server Function finishes executing, rather than waiting for the response:

## Nested form elements[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#nested-form-elements)

You can call Server Actions in elements nested inside `<form>` such as `<button>`, `<input type="submit">`, and `<input type="image">`. These elements accept the `formAction` prop or event handlers.

This is useful in cases where you want to call multiple Server Actions within a form. For example, you can create a specific `<button>` element for saving a post draft in addition to publishing it. See the [React `<form>` docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#handling-multiple-submission-types) for more information.

## Programmatic form submission[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/forms#programmatic-form-submission)

You can trigger a form submission programmatically using the [`requestSubmit()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/requestSubmit) method. For example, when the user submits a form using the `⌘` + `Enter` keyboard shortcut, you can listen for the `onKeyDown` event:

This will trigger the submission of the nearest `<form>` ancestor, which will invoke the Server Function.
