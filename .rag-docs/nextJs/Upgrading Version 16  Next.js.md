## How to upgrade to version 16

Last updated

December 9, 2025

## Upgrading from 15 to 16[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#upgrading-from-15-to-16)

### Using AI Agents with Next.js DevTools MCP[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#using-ai-agents-with-nextjs-devtools-mcp)

If you're using an AI coding assistant that supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you can use the **Next.js DevTools MCP** to automate the upgrade process and migration tasks.

#### Setup[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#setup)

Add the following configuration to your MCP client, example:

For more information, visit the [`next-devtools-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-devtools-mcp) package on npm to configure with your MCP client.

> **Note:** Using `next-devtools-mcp@latest` ensures that your MCP client will always use the latest version of the Next.js DevTools MCP server.

#### Example Prompts[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#example-prompts)

Once configured, you can use natural language prompts to upgrade your Next.js app:

**To upgrade to Next.js 16:**

Connect to your coding agent and then prompt:

**To migrate to Cache Components (after upgrading to v16):**

Connect to your coding agent and then prompt:

### Using the Codemod[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#using-the-codemod)

To update to Next.js version 16, you can use the `upgrade` [codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/codemods#160):

The [codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/codemods#160) is able to:

-   Update `next.config.js` to use the new `turbopack` configuration
-   Migrate from `next lint` to the ESLint CLI
-   Migrate from deprecated `middleware` convention to `proxy`
-   Remove `unstable_` prefix from stabilized APIs
-   Remove `experimental_ppr` Route Segment Config from pages and layouts

If you prefer to do it manually, install the latest Next.js and React versions:

If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their latest versions.

## Node.js runtime and browser support[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#nodejs-runtime-and-browser-support)

|  Requirement  |                         Change / Details                         |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node.js 20.9+ | Minimum version now `20.9.0` (LTS); Node.js 18 no longer supported |
| TypeScript 5+ |                    Minimum version now `5.1.0`                     |
|   Browsers    |        Chrome 111+, Edge 111+, Firefox 111+, Safari 16.4+        |

## Turbopack by default[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#turbopack-by-default)

Starting with **Next.js 16**, Turbopack is stable and used by default with `next dev` and `next build`

Previously you had to enable Turbopack using `--turbopack`, or `--turbo`.

This is no longer necessary. You can update your `package.json` scripts:

If your project has a [custom `webpack`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/webpack) configuration and you run `next build` (which now uses Turbopack by default), the build will **fail** to prevent misconfiguration issues.

You have a few different ways to address this:

-   **Use Turbopack anyway:** Run with `next build --turbopack` to build using Turbopack and ignore your `webpack` config.
-   **Switch to Turbopack fully:** Migrate your `webpack` config to Turbopack-compatible options.
-   **Keep using Webpack:** Use the `--webpack` flag to opt out of Turbopack and build with Webpack.

> **Good to know**: If you see failing builds because a `webpack` configuration was found, but you don't define one yourself, it is likely that a plugin is adding a `webpack` option

### Opting out of Turbopack[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#opting-out-of-turbopack)

If you need to continue using Webpack, you can opt out with the `--webpack` flag. For example, to use Turbopack in development but Webpack for production builds:

We recommend using Turbopack for development and production. Submit a comment to this [thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77721), if you are unable to switch to Turbopack.

### Turbopack configuration location[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#turbopack-configuration-location)

The `experimental.turbopack` configuration is out of experimental.

You can use it as a top-level `turbopack` option:

Make sure to review the `Turbopack` configuration [options](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack). **Next.js 16** introduces various improvements and new options, for example:

-   [Advanced Webpack loader conditions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#advanced-webpack-loader-conditions)
-   [debugIds](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#debug-ids)

### Resolve alias fallback[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#resolve-alias-fallback)

In some projects, client-side code may import files containing Node.js native modules. This will cause `Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'` type of errors.

When this happens, you should refactor your code so that your client-side bundles do not reference these Node.js native modules.

However, in some cases, this might not be possible. In Webpack the `resolve.fallback` option was typically used to **silence** the error. Turbopack offers a similar option, using `turbopack.resolveAlias`. In this case, tell Turbopack to load an empty module when `fs` is requested for the browser.

It is preferable to refactor your modules so that client code doesn't ever import from modules using Node.js native modules.

### Sass node\_modules imports[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#sass-node_modules-imports)

Turbopack fully supports importing Sass files from `node_modules`. Note that while Webpack allowed the legacy tilde (`~`) prefix, Turbopack does not support this syntax.

In Webpack:

In Turbopack:

If changing the imports is not possible, you can use `turbopack.resolveAlias`. For example:

### Turbopack File System Caching (beta)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#turbopack-file-system-caching-beta)

Turbopack now supports filesystem caching in development, storing compiler artifacts on disk between runs for significantly faster compile times across restarts.

Enable filesystem caching in your configuration:

## Async Request APIs (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#async-request-apis-breaking-change)

Version 15 introduced [Async Request APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-15#async-request-apis-breaking-change) as a breaking change, with **temporary** synchronous compatibility.

Starting with **Next.js 16**, synchronous access is fully removed. These APIs can only be accessed asynchronously.

-   [`cookies`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)
-   [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers)
-   [`draftMode`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/draft-mode)
-   `params` in [`layout.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout), [`page.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), [`route.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route), [`default.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default), [`opengraph-image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#opengraph-image), [`twitter-image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#twitter-image), [`icon`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons#icon), and [`apple-icon`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons#apple-icon).
-   `searchParams` in [`page.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)

Use the [codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/codemods#migrate-to-async-dynamic-apis) to migrate to async Dynamic APIs.

### Migrating types for async Dynamic APIs[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#migrating-types-for-async-dynamic-apis)

To help migrate to async `params` and `searchParams`, you can run [`npx next typegen`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-typegen-options) to automatically generate these globally available types helpers:

-   [`PageProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#page-props-helper)
-   [`LayoutProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#layout-props-helper)
-   [`RouteContext`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route#route-context-helper)

> **Good to know**: `typegen` was introduced in Next.js 15.5

This simplifies type-safe migration to the new async API pattern, and enables you to update your components with full type safety, for example:

This approach gives you fully type-safe access to `props.params`, including the `slug`, and to `searchParams`, directly within your page.

## Async parameters for icon, and open-graph Image (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#async-parameters-for-icon-and-open-graph-image-breaking-change)

> The props passed to the image generating functions in `opengraph-image`, `twitter-image`, `icon`, and `apple-icon`, are now Promises.

In previous versions, both the `Image` (image generation function), and the `generateImageMetadata` received a `params` object. The `id` returned by `generateImageMetadata` was passed as a string to the image generation function.

Starting with **Next.js 16**, to align with the [Async Request APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#async-request-apis-breaking-change) change, the image generating function now receives `params` and `id` as promises. The `generateImageMetadata` function continues to receive synchronous `params`.

## Async `id` parameter for `sitemap` (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#async-id-parameter-for-sitemap-breaking-change)

Previously, the `id` values returned from [`generateSitemaps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-sitemaps) were passed directly to the `sitemap` generating function.

Starting with **Next.js 16**, the `sitemap` generating function now receives `id` as a promise.

## React 19.2[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#react-192)

The App Router in **Next.js 16** uses the latest React [Canary release](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries), which includes the newly released React 19.2 features and other features being incrementally stabilized. Highlights include:

-   **[View Transitions](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition)**: Animate elements that update inside a Transition or navigation
-   **[`useEffectEvent`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffectEvent)**: Extract non-reactive logic from Effects into reusable Effect Event functions
-   **[Activity](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity)**: Render "background activity" by hiding UI with `display: none` while maintaining state and cleaning up Effects

Learn more in the [React 19.2 announcement](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/01/react-19-2).

## React Compiler Support[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#react-compiler-support)

Built-in support for the React Compiler is now stable in **Next.js 16** following the React Compiler's 1.0 release. The React Compiler automatically memoizes components, reducing unnecessary re-renders with zero manual code changes.

The `reactCompiler` configuration option has been promoted from `experimental` to stable. It is not enabled by default as we continue gathering build performance data across different application types.

Install the latest version of the React Compiler plugin:

> **Good to know:** Expect compile times in development and during builds to be higher when enabling this option as the React Compiler relies on Babel.

## Caching APIs[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#caching-apis)

### revalidateTag[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#revalidatetag)

[`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) has a new function signature. You can pass a [`cacheLife`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife#reference) profile as the second argument.

Use `revalidateTag` for content where a slight delay in updates is acceptable, such as blog posts, product catalogs, or documentation. Users receive stale content while fresh data loads in the background.

### updateTag[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#updatetag)

[`updateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag) is a new [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/updating-data#what-are-server-functions)\-only API that provides **read-your-writes** semantics, where a user makes a change and the UI immediately shows the change, rather than stale data.

It does this by expiring and immediately refreshing data within the same request.

This ensures interactive features reflect changes immediately. Perfect for forms, user settings, and any workflow where users expect to see their updates instantly.

Learn more about when to use `updateTag` or `revalidateTag` [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/updateTag#when-to-use-updatetag).

### refresh[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#refresh)

[`refresh`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/refresh) allows you to refresh the client router from within a Server Action.

Use it when you need to refresh the client router after performing an action.

### cacheLife and cacheTag[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#cachelife-and-cachetag)

[`cacheLife`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheLife) and [`cacheTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cacheTag) are now stable. The `unstable_` prefix is no longer needed.

Wherever you had aliased imports like:

You can update your imports to:

## Enhanced Routing and Navigation[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#enhanced-routing-and-navigation)

**Next.js 16** includes a complete overhaul of the routing and navigation system, making page transitions leaner and faster. This optimizes how Next.js prefetches and caches navigation data:

-   **Layout deduplication**: When prefetching multiple URLs with a shared layout, the layout is downloaded once.
-   **Incremental prefetching**: Next.js only prefetches parts not already in cache, rather than entire pages.

These changes require **no code modifications** and are designed to improve performance across all apps.

However, you may see more individual prefetch requests with much lower total transfer sizes. We believe this is the right trade-off for nearly all applications.

If the increased request count causes issues, please let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues) or [discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions) item.

## Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#partial-pre-rendering-ppr)

**Next.js 16** removes the experimental **Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)** flag and configuration options, including the route level segment `experimental_ppr`.

Starting with **Next.js 16**, you can opt into PPR using the [`cacheComponents`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents) configuration.

PPR in **Next.js 16** works differently than in **Next.js 15** canaries. If you are using PPR today, stay in the current Next.js 15 canary you are using. We will follow up with a guide to migrate to Cache Components.

## `middleware` to `proxy`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#middleware-to-proxy)

The `middleware` filename is deprecated, and has been renamed to `proxy` to clarify network boundary and routing focus.

The `edge` runtime is **NOT** supported in `proxy`. The `proxy` runtime is `nodejs`, and it cannot be configured. If you want to continue using the `edge` runtime, keep using `middleware`. We will follow up on a minor release with further `edge` runtime instructions.

The named export `middleware` is also deprecated. Rename your function to `proxy`.

We recommend changing the function name to `proxy`, even if you are using a default export.

Configuration flags that contained the `middleware` name are also renamed. For example, `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` is now `skipProxyUrlNormalize`

The version 16 [codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/codemods#160) is able to update these flags too.

## `next/image` changes[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#nextimage-changes)

### Local Images with Query Strings (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#local-images-with-query-strings-breaking-change)

Local image sources with query strings now require `images.localPatterns.search` configuration to prevent enumeration attacks.

If you need to use query strings with local images, add the pattern to your configuration:

### `minimumCacheTTL` Default (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#minimumcachettl-default-breaking-change)

The default value for `images.minimumCacheTTL` has changed from `60 seconds` to `4 hours` (14400 seconds). This reduces revalidation cost for images without cache-control headers.

For some Next.js users, image revalidation was happening frequently, often because the upstream source images missed a `cache-control` header. This caused revalidation to happen every `60` seconds, which increased CPU usage and cost.

Since most images do not change often, this short interval is not ideal. Setting the default to 4 hours offers a more durable cache by default, while still allowing images to update a few times per day if needed.

If you need the previous behavior, change `minimumCacheTTL` to a lower value, for example back to `60` seconds:

### `imageSizes` Default (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#imagesizes-default-breaking-change)

The value `16` has been removed from the default `images.imageSizes` array.

We have looked at request analytics and found out that very few projects ever serve 16 pixels width images. Removing this setting reduces the size of the `srcset` attribute shipped to the browser by `next/image`.

If you need to support 16px images:

Rather than lack of developer usage, we believe 16 pixels width images have become less common, because `devicePixelRatio: 2` actually fetches a 32px image to prevent blurriness in retina displays.

### `qualities` Default (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#qualities-default-breaking-change)

The default value for `images.qualities` has changed from allowing all qualities to only `[75]`.

If you need to support multiple quality levels:

If you specify a `quality` prop not included in the `image.qualities` array, the quality will be coerced to the closest value in `images.qualities`. For example, given the configuration above, a `quality` prop of 80, is coerced to 75.

### Local IP Restriction (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#local-ip-restriction-breaking-change)

A new security restriction blocks local IP optimization by default. Set `images.dangerouslyAllowLocalIP` to `true` only for private networks.

### Maximum Redirects (Breaking change)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#maximum-redirects-breaking-change)

The default for `images.maximumRedirects` has changed from unlimited to 3 redirects maximum.

### `next/legacy/image` Component (deprecated)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#nextlegacyimage-component-deprecated)

The `next/legacy/image` component is deprecated. Use `next/image` instead:

### `images.domains` Configuration (deprecated)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#imagesdomains-configuration-deprecated)

The `images.domains` config is deprecated.

Use `images.remotePatterns` instead for improved security:

## Concurrent `dev` and `build`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#concurrent-dev-and-build)

`next dev` and `next build` now use separate output directories, enabling concurrent execution. The `next dev` command outputs to `.next/dev`. This is the new default behavior, controlled by [isolatedDevBuild](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/isolatedDevBuild).

Additionally, a lockfile mechanism prevents multiple `next dev` or `next build` instances on the same project.

Since the development server outputs to `.next/dev`, the [Turbopack tracing command](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/local-development#turbopack-tracing) should be:

## Parallel Routes `default.js` requirement[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#parallel-routes-defaultjs-requirement)

All [parallel route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes) slots now require explicit `default.js` files. Builds will fail without them.

To maintain previous behavior, create a [`default.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default) file that calls `notFound()` or returns `null`.

Or return `null`:

## ESLint Flat Config[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#eslint-flat-config)

`@next/eslint-plugin-next` now defaults to ESLint Flat Config format, aligning with ESLint v10 which will drop legacy config support.

Make sure to review our API reference for the [`@next/eslint-plugin-next`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#setup-eslint) plugin.

If you're using the legacy `.eslintrc` format, consider migrating to the flat config format. See the [ESLint migration guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide) for details.

In **previous versions of Next.js**, if you had set `scroll-behavior: smooth` globally on your `<html>` element via CSS, Next.js would override this during SPA route transitions, as follows:

1.  Temporarily set `scroll-behavior` to `auto`
2.  Perform the navigation (causing instant scroll to top)
3.  Restore your original `scroll-behavior` value

This ensured that page navigation always felt snappy and instant, even when you had smooth scrolling enabled for in-page navigation. However, this manipulation could be expensive, especially at the start of every navigation.

In **Next.js 16**, this behavior has changed. By default, Next.js will **no longer override** your `scroll-behavior` setting during navigation.

**If you want Next.js to perform this override** (the previous default behavior), add the `data-scroll-behavior="smooth"` attribute to your `<html>` element:

## Performance Improvements[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#performance-improvements)

Significant performance optimizations for `next dev` and `next start` commands, along with improved terminal output with clearer formatting, better error messages, and improved performance metrics.

**Next.js 16** removes the `size` and `First Load JS` metrics from the `next build` output. We found these to be inaccurate in server-driven architectures using React Server Components. Both our Turbopack and Webpack implementations had issues, and disagreed on how to account for Client Components payload.

The most effective way to measure actual route performance is through tools such as [Chrome Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) or Vercel Analytics, which focus on Core Web Vitals and downloaded resource sizes.

### `next dev` config load[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#next-dev-config-load)

In previous versions the Next config file was loaded twice during development:

-   When running the `next dev` command
-   When the `next dev` command started the Next.js server

This was inefficient because the `next dev` command doesn't need the config file to start the Next.js server.

A consequence of this change is that, when running `next dev` checking if `process.argv` includes `'dev'`, in your Next.js config file, will return `false`.

> **Good to know**: The `typegen`, and `build` commands, are still visible in `process.argv`.

This is specially important for plugins that trigger side-effects on `next dev`. If that's the case, it might be enough to check if `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`.

Alternatively, use the [`phase`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js#phase) in which the configuration is loaded.

## Build Adapters API (alpha)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#build-adapters-api-alpha)

Following the [Build Adapters RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77740), the first alpha version of the Build Adapters API is now available.

Build Adapters allow you to create custom adapters that hook into the build process, enabling deployment platforms and custom build integrations to modify Next.js configuration or process build output.

Share your feedback in the [RFC discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/77740).

## Modern Sass API[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#modern-sass-api)

`sass-loader` has been bumped to v16, which supports [modern Sass syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/#md:usage) and new features.

## Removals[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#removals)

These features were previously deprecated and are now removed:

### AMP Support[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#amp-support)

AMP adoption has declined significantly, and maintaining this feature adds complexity to the framework. All AMP APIs and configurations have been removed:

-   `amp` configuration from your Next config file
-   `next/amp` hook imports and usage (`useAmp`)

-   `export const config = { amp: true }` from pages

Evaluate if AMP is still necessary for your use case. Most performance benefits can now be achieved through Next.js's built-in optimizations and modern web standards.

### `next lint` Command[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#next-lint-command)

The `next lint` command has been removed. Use Biome or ESLint directly. `next build` no longer runs linting.

A codemod is available to automate migration:

The `eslint` option in the Next.js config file is also removed.

### Runtime Configuration[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#runtime-configuration)

`serverRuntimeConfig` and `publicRuntimeConfig` have been removed. Use environment variables instead.

**Before (Next.js 15):**

**After (Next.js 16):**

For server-only values, access environment variables directly in Server Components:

> **Good to know**: Use the [taint API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/taint) to prevent accidentally passing sensitive server values to Client Components.

For client-accessible values, use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix:

To ensure environment variables are read at runtime (not bundled at build time), use the [`connection()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/connection) function before reading from `process.env`:

Learn more about [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables).

### `devIndicators` Options[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#devindicators-options)

The following options have been removed from [`devIndicators`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/devIndicators):

-   `appIsrStatus`
-   `buildActivity`
-   `buildActivityPosition`

The indicator itself remains available.

### `experimental.dynamicIO`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#experimentaldynamicio)

The `experimental.dynamicIO` flag has been renamed to `cacheComponents`:

Update your Next config file, by removing the `dynamicIO` flag.

Add the [`cacheComponents`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents) flag set to true.

### `unstable_rootParams`[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-16#unstable_rootparams)

The `unstable_rootParams` function has been removed. We are working on an alternative API that we will ship in an upcoming minor release.
