When proxy is used, Next.js automatically clones the request body and buffers it in memory to enable multiple reads - both in proxy and the underlying route handler. To prevent excessive memory usage, this configuration option sets a size limit on the buffered body.

By default, the maximum body size is **10MB**. If a request body exceeds this limit, the body will only be buffered up to the limit, and a warning will be logged indicating which route exceeded the limit.

## Options[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/proxyClientMaxBodySize#options)

### String format (recommended)[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/proxyClientMaxBodySize#string-format-recommended)

Specify the size using a human-readable string format:

Supported units: `b`, `kb`, `mb`, `gb`

### Number format[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/proxyClientMaxBodySize#number-format)

Alternatively, specify the size in bytes as a number:

## Behavior[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/proxyClientMaxBodySize#behavior)

When a request body exceeds the configured limit:

1.  Next.js will buffer only the first N bytes (up to the limit)
2.  A warning will be logged to the console indicating the route that exceeded the limit
3.  The request will continue processing normally, but only the partial body will be available
4.  The request will **not** fail or return an error to the client

If your application needs to process the full request body, you should either:

-   Increase the `proxyClientMaxBodySize` limit
-   Handle the partial body gracefully in your application logic

## Good to know[](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/proxyClientMaxBodySize#good-to-know)

-   This setting only applies when proxy is used in your application
-   The default limit of 10MB is designed to balance memory usage and typical use cases
-   The limit applies per-request, not globally across all concurrent requests
-   For applications handling large file uploads, consider increasing the limit accordingly
