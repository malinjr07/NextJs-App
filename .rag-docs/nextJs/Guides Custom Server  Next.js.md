## How to set up a custom server in Next.js

Last updated

December 10, 2025

Next.js includes its own server with `next start` by default. If you have an existing backend, you can still use it with Next.js (this is not a custom server). A custom Next.js server allows you to programmatically start a server for custom patterns. The majority of the time, you will not need this approach. However, it's available if you need to eject.

> **Good to know**:
> 
> -   Before deciding to use a custom server, keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like **[Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization).**
> -   When using standalone output mode, it does not trace custom server files. This mode outputs a separate minimal `server.js` file, instead. These cannot be used together.

Take a look at the [following example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server) of a custom server:

> `server.js` does not run through the Next.js Compiler or bundling process. Make sure the syntax and source code this file requires are compatible with the current Node.js version you are using. [View an example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server).

To run the custom server, you'll need to update the `scripts` in `package.json` like so:

Alternatively, you can set up `nodemon` ([example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server)). The custom server uses the following import to connect the server with the Next.js application:

The above `next` import is a function that receives an object with the following options:

|   Option   |       Type       |                                   Description                                   |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    `conf`    |      `Object`      |         The same object you would use in `next.config.js`. Defaults to `{}`         |
|    `dev`     |     `Boolean`      |   (_Optional_) Whether or not to launch Next.js in dev mode. Defaults to `false`    |
|    `dir`     |      `String`      |           (_Optional_) Location of the Next.js project. Defaults to `'.'`           |
|   `quiet`    |     `Boolean`      | (_Optional_) Hide error messages containing server information. Defaults to `false` |
|  `hostname`  |      `String`      |              (_Optional_) The hostname the server is running behind               |
|    `port`    |      `Number`      |                (_Optional_) The port the server is running behind                 |
| `httpServer` | `node:http#Server` |            (_Optional_) The HTTP Server that Next.js is running behind            |
| `turbopack`  |     `Boolean`      |                (_Optional_) Enable Turbopack (enabled by default)                 |
|  `webpack`   |     `Boolean`      |                            (_Optional_) Enable webpack                            |

The returned `app` can then be used to let Next.js handle requests as required.
